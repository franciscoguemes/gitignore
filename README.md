.gitignore
=========================

A collection of .gitignore files that I use in my projects. Feel free to take any `.gitignore` file that may be useful for you and use them as whatever you like.

If you do not find a `.gitignore` file that is suitable to you, just create a new one in an specific directory i.e. `javascript`, `angular`, `react`, `kotlin`, `PHP`, etc ... Collaborations are welcome!
